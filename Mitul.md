# Mitul Patel

Itâ€™s been an amazing experience staying with the devlup labs.
- It has provided me a platform to gain & share new information from & with a group of very enthusiastic people.
- It has provided me a group of very interesting people to watch apple-events with
- I hope to do more interesting things with the group.
- I hope that you either get a lot of opportunities to show your talent or create a shitload of opportunities for others.
- Stay Safe & Healthy and beware of offline exams. (This one is to address covid-19).

You can call me for anything anytime except from 11:59 pm - 6:00 am (& This one is for you Manav Kapoor ðŸ˜œ).

Thank You, Ajat, Anshul & the group.
