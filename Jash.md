Konnichiwa minasan,
- I would like to start this with a huge thanks to Devlup Labs and its founding members Ajat and Anshul. I have learned a lot from you guys since my first year in college. It was great sharing projects and working under your mentorship. I still remember Ajat's obsession to motivate every guy for buying a Macbook. Anshul se zyaadatar baat stopstalk ke liye hui. He helped me being a mentor for the project.
- Kudos to Soham and Tanuj for teaching me git patiently and helping me solve my merge conflicts. I will always remember Harsh and Yashvi for notion, Dhruv for UI/UX, Mitul for blockchain, Anmol for NatGeo(IGNUS), Kaustubh for Prometeo and Varchas.  
- The juniors(Sandesh, Abhishek, Aditi, Darshit, Manav) have been exceptionally good in taking the legacy forward and piling up the project list. Thank you for the customized t-shirts and I love explaining the connection to everyone I meet.

Would love to be a part of Devlup labs and feel free to contact me for anything.
